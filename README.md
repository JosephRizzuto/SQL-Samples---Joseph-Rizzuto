🚀 How to Use

Open your SQL client (MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, etc.).

Run sales_data.sql first to create the database and populate the tables.

Execute the remaining files individually:

marketing_performance_revenue_analysis.sql

customer_insights_advanced_querying.sql

Review the query outputs and modify queries to explore additional business insights.

Note: The analysis files depend on the schema and data created in sales_data.sql, so it must be executed first.
